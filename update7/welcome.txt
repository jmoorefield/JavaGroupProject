Here are the rules of the game:

Player order is automatically generated by comparing the lexicographical order of randomly selected tiles. Each player has 7 tiles each turn to create a word to put on the board. In total, each game has 100 available tiles. 

The first play must use the board's center tile. Only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed. A word must be at least two tiles long if it does not use an existing tile on the board; it must be at least one tile if it does. A word cannot be longer than 15 tiles, the length of the board. If a player has a blank tile, they can substitute that tile for any letter. 

A valid move must be a word found in the dictionary. If a move is valid, a player's score is increased by the sum of the points value of the tiles from their move. No tile can be moved if it is already played as part of a valid move. New moves can be formed by adding tiles to an existing word or tiles; placing a word at a right angle to an existing word that uses at least one existing title; or placing a valid word parallel to an existing word so that adjacent tiles also form complete words.

Press the Make Move button to put tiles on the board, and click End Turn when finished. Click Cancel to erase your current move from the board. If a player cannot make a move with their tiles and the current state of the board, press the Pass button to move to the next player with no penalty. If no player can make a move or there are no more possible moves on the board, click the No More Moves button to end the game. The game will also end if there are no more tiles left to repopulate players' tile racks.

At the end of the game, final scores are calculated by subtracting from the player's current score the sum of the points value of the tiles left in their rack.
