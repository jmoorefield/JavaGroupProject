The set up to run the program is quite complicaed as one has to set up the javafx libraries for the program to even compile.
Will try to fix this issue for you guys to able to actually work on the .java files.
Aside from that, save the folder "src", folder "TileImages", and the textfile "letterBag.txt" in one folder to avoid issues with FileIputStreams.
