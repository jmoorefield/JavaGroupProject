1) You have to download the javafx libraries. Here is the site: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/   
Download the "SDK" file that works with your operating system. Download version JavaFx 16.

2) Download all the .java files I have uploaded. They are in the "src" folder. 
(Jess I don't know yet how your dictionary class is supposed to be implemented). 
Also download the "TileImages" folder, the "letterBag.txt" textfile and the "compile.sh" shell file.

3) Place JavaFx 16 library folder, all the .java files from "src" folder, the "TileImages" folder, 
the "letterBag.txt" textfile and "compile.sh" shell file in one folder. (NOTE: the JavaFx 16 library folder should be named javafx-sdk-16!!)

Now it should be noted that all of this is going to be run from a shell aka linux or terminal.
If your enviroment is not set up with java then the compile.sh shell script will not work. 

4) Open the folder that has all the downloaded files form the terminal. 
To run just type in your terminal ./compile.sh and it should work. If not make sure you set up everything like I said. 
If it still does not work then send me a message. 
(NOTE: This will not run on linprog servers. The obvious reason being that linprog is a server. 
Your last option is to set up java on your computer enviroment, 
to be able to run java commands from your terminal, or setting a path on your IDE of preference. 
(side note : I know how to do the latter only with jetbrains IDEs))
