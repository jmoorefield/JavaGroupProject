the loop over ViewRack in updateRack() in PlayerRack.java isn't working, 
so i have no idea how to repopulate the racks.
i did figure out how to clear tiles from the board by adding a new tile over every one in currentMove, 
but it erases the grid lines between tiles when i do that. i think clearMove() in Board was supposed to be an alternative to that method, 
but i have no idea if i wrote it correctly--please feel free to change it if you see errors.
at this point i think the only main work left is removing tiles from the board correctly, repopulating the racks, and dealing with blank tiles.
